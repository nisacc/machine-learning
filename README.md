Linear regression is defined as an algorithm that provides a linear relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of future events.
 It is a statistical method used in data science and machine learning for predictive analysis.

The independent variable is also the predictor or explanatory variable that remains unchanged due to the change in other variables. However, the dependent variable changes with fluctuations in the independent variable. The regression model predicts the value of the dependent variable, which is the response or outcome variable being analyzed or studied.

Thus, linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that simulates a mathematical relationship between variables and makes predictions for continuous or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

This analysis method is advantageous when at least two variables are available in the data, as observed in stock market forecasting, portfolio management, scientific analysis, etc.
